    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in the <b>1st Workshop on Innovation Measurement for Scientific Communication (IMSC) in the Era of Big Data</b>, to be held as part of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2023, Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 26 – 30, 2023 (<a href=" https://2023.jcdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCDL2023</a>).
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose of the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The increasingly mature artificial intelligence technologies, such as big data, deep learning, and natural language processing, provide technical support for research on automatic text understanding and bring development opportunities for innovative measurement of scientific communication. Innovation measurement in scientific communication is a challenging and cutting-edge direction in Informetrics. It is interdisciplinary, requiring considering the characteristics of different disciplines and different types of scientific outcomes to establish a comprehensive evaluation metrics system. On the other hand, metadata and content features should be considered to reflect the innovation of scientific works objectively and comprehensively. This workshop focuses on the discussion and produces enlightening outcomes. We will engage broad audiences to share their ideas and pre-productions, enabling an interdisciplinary approach to exploring frontier areas. This workshop consists of keynotes, oral presentations, and poster sessions and would attract interest from academic researchers, librarians, and decision-makers from governments and practical sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Science innovation and breakthroughs are the key driving force for scientific and technological advances. Measuring and tracking these innovative studies is an essential direction in informetrics and Science of Science. In the big data era, the development of informatics is full of risks and opportunities. A large number of papers is published, but it is challenging to automatically identify and track innovative publications because of their scarcity. Advancement of artificial intelligence, in particular natural language processing and knowledge reasoning, provides potential solutions, using large-scale pre-trained language models, knowledge graphs based on scholarly communication and using full-text analytics to extract and evaluate knowledge entities [4,5]. As stated in the Leiden Manifesto [1], quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been proposed to measure the innovativeness of knowledge in science communication. For example, Zhang et al. used network analysis to characterize emerging technologies [7]; Luo et al. measured the originality or novelty of scholarly articles based on combinatorial novelty theory [2]; Savov et al. applied topic models and bibliometric features to identify highly cited papers or breakthrough papers [3]. Meanwhile, Wu et al. proposed a revised architecture, enhanced hardware, and software infrastructure for digital library to manage scholarly big data [6]. Identifying the main factors of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution provides a broader perspective on measuring the innovative nature of science. Therefore, we propose this workshop to gather researchers and practical users to initiate a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue.

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Poster & demonstration</b>: We welcome submissions detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial applications of knowledge entities extraction ande evaluation for a special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These papers should follow the same format as the research track papers but can be shorter (2 pages for <b>poster and demo papers</b>).
	</p>
	<p>
		All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. <b>Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per paper needs to register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work.</b> In case of no-show the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the proceedings and from the program.
