    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in the <b>1st Workshop on Utilizing AI/ML to Enhance Information Extraction, Organization, and Retrieval from Large-scale Archival Collections</b>, to be held as part of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2024, Hong Kong, Dec 20th, 2024 (<a href=" https://2024.jcdl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCDL2024</a>).
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose of the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
	This workshop addresses the challenges faced by archivists, historians, and researchers in managing and utilizing large-scale digital archives. As the digitization of historical records has expanded access to vast collections, the complexity and volume of data have created significant obstacles in ensuring these resources are effectively accessible and usable. This workshop focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to revolutionize the processing, analysis, and retrieval of large-scale archival collections. By integrating computational methods with archival practices, the workshop aims to explore novel frameworks, tools, and best practices that can advance the field of Computational Archival Science (CAS). The workshop will feature a combination of keynote presentations, oral sessions, and poster presentations to facilitate the exchange of ideas and collaboration among experts from various disciplines, including information science, computer science, and digital humanities. Participants of this workshop will gain insights into the latest advancements in AI/ML technologies for digital archives and contribute to shaping the future of archival science.
    </p>
    <p>
	The digitization of historical records (also called “digital archives”) has opened a variety of large-scale digital collections to the world. The scale and complexity of digital archives are posing enormous challenges for both researchers and memory institutions. One of the generally acknowledged challenges by the archive community is discovering, using, and analyzing digital archives for public service. It is impossible for archivists or historians alone to find a magical solution that will instantly make digital records more accessible and useful [2, 5, 7, 8]. Recently, the computational archival science (CAS), which integrates computational methods and tools, such as artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to the archival field to address large-scale digital records/archives processing, analysis, storage, and access [6], has been proposed and identified as a novel and effective approach to resolve the challenges. To promote the applications of AI/ML in digital archives, founding agencies such as Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), National Historical Publications & Records Commission (NHPRC), and The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in the United States have been funding more and more grants related to this area. Although scholars from different communities such as Information Science and Computer Science has explored the applications of natural language processing (NLP), semantic analysis (SA), computer version (CV) on different archival collections such as oral history, culture heritage, historical newspaper [1, 3, 10, 11], there are still some obstacles for archive professions and researchers using computational methods especial advanced techniques into practice: (1) Lacking high-quality, large-scale, and open-sourced corpus for developing effective ML/DL models. (2) Lacking AI/ML tools that developed for processing, annotating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale multivariate heterogeneous archival data. (3) Lacking hands-on resources that can teach archive professions and researchers how to use AI/ML tools for dealing with large-scale archival collections in different scenarios. With the development of generative AI such as ChatGPT [4, 9, 12], it is even more beneficial and urgent to utilize AI/ML to enhance information extraction, organization, retrieval and other applications through developing more effective and reusable models and exploring the best practices. Therefore, we propose this workshop to gather researchers and practical users to initiate a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue.
